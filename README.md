# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This program lets users play the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors using JavaScript through the Google Chrome console.
The game consists of five rounds where scores are saved and the outcome is declared.

## How to Run
- Open `index.html` in your browser (it will be a blank page with only the script linked).
- Open Developer Tools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
- Go to the Console tab.
- Refresh the page to see the game start and interact with the console.

## Final Thoughts

This project was the most fun I have ever had writing code, because for the first time I wrote a program without finding the solutions or asking ChatGPT for the answer.

Although this is a simple project, the joy I felt when I finally found the last bug and completed it was a very special moment for me, and one that I will never forget.
